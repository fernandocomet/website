    <section class="researcher">
        <h1>Researcher</h1>
        <p>I studied philosophy so my first approach always comes from this area. I like very much anthropology and sociology, as a result before starting any project, I make a lot of research in these areas to understand product, customer and user better. I do a lot of sketching before jumping to UX methodologies, CUALITATIVAS Y CUANTITATIVAS / EJEMPLOS</p>

        <h1>Animator</h1>
        <p>I come from the background of Display Advertising where I worked in Digital Agencies first, and then on Adserving as Ad Spcialist. For more than 8 years my work was giving support to creative and media agencies. This involved production, design, coding, support, trainings and workshops, documentation, creation of new Ad Formats and campaign coordination, giving support for the most known Advertisers and more than 200 agencies in Spain, Europe and Latam markets. I can animate for UX using tools as Principle or After Effects. I am an expert on Adobe AnimateCC, Google Web Designer and can animate also by code using libraries such as Gsap, Velocity, Anime or Pixi. I am using also last trends on svg animation.</p>
